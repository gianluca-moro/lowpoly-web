    This tool can be used to convert images to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Low_poly"
      target="_blank">Low-Poly</a> art style. <br>
    I really like low-poly art and thus, I wanted to create a tool that I can use to automatically create low-poly
    images.
  </p>

<div class="about mt-3">
  The converter is implemented in JavaScript and works as follows
  <ol>
    <li>The image is converted to gray-scale</li>
    <li>
      We then blur the gray-scale image twice with different blur strengths and calculate the difference between those
      images for each pixel. <br>
      This will give a higher difference value for pixels that are "more interesting", e.g., on object edges or where
      colours change, while giving lower difference values for pixels in areas that are more uniform. <br>
      For the image blur, we are using <a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/stackblur-canvas"
        target="_blank">stackblur-canvas (npm)</a>, which gives us an almost Gaussian blur with great performance.
    </li>
    <li>
      We then perform <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rejection_sampling" target="_blank">Rejection Sampling</a>
      on these pixel differences to randomly select n (= number of triangulation points) pixels. <br>
      Note that since we perform the rejection sampling on the pixel differences, pixels that are "more interesting"
      will be sampled with a higher probability. This ensures that we have more smaller triangles in more interesting
      areas while fewer but larger triangles in less interesting areas.
    </li>
    <li>
      We then use <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Delaunay_triangulation" target="_blank">Delaunay
        Triangulation</a> to triangulate the sampled pixels, i.e., we create a set of triangles that do not overlap.
      <br>
      For the triangulation, we are using <a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/delaunator" target="_blank">
        Delaunator (npm)</a>.
    </li>
    <li>
      Finally, we draw the triangles on the output image.
      To get the colour for each triangle, we calculate the midpoint of the triangle and pick the colour of the original
      image at that pixel.
    </li>
  </ol>

  I have also implemented the algorithm in Python, which is also available on
